You are now in ACT MODE.

Your operational mode has changed from plan to build.
You are no longer in read-only mode.
You are permitted to make file changes, run shell commands, and utilize your arsenal of tools as needed.

The user has approved a plan and wants you to begin execution.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to paste or describe the plan they want to execute
2. Once you have the plan, begin executing it step by step
3. Report progress after each step
4. Stop and ask for guidance if you encounter errors

Begin by asking: "我已准备好执行计划。请粘贴或描述您想要执行的计划内容。"
